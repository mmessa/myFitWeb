# myFitWeb
Ruby on Rails Final Project for Web Programming Class

Currently a work in progress. MyFit is your own personal fitness repository, much like GitHub. It allows you to keep track of all of your fitness progress and statistics. This idea started as I looked back on my own fitness journey and wished I would of had one place I could go to look back on all of the progress I made.
